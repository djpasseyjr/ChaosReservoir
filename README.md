# ChaosReservoir
Repo for writing and running experiments on the effect of network topology on a reservoir computer's ability to learn the Lorentz equations.

Click [here](Papers/djpassey_thesis.pdf) for the masters thesis that started this project (p. 32-end will be the most relevant). Click [here](Papers/attractor_recon.pdf) for a paper about reservoir computing. Click [here](Papers/spect_dyn_specialization.pdf) for a paper about network specialization.

### Plan
**Week 1**
* [ ] Introduction to Reservoir Computers, Network Topology and Lorentz Equations

Tasks:
* [ ] Identify reasonable parameter ranges for the system
* [ ] Send the ranges to a designated group member
* [ ] Designated member generates experiments for all parameter ranges

**Week 2**
* [ ] How to Use the Super Computer

Tasks:
* [ ] Designated member sends out experiments
* [ ] Each team member runs the experiments and starts data analysis

**Week 3**
* [ ] What to Look for in the Data

Tasks:
* [ ] Analyze Datasets

**Week 4**
* [ ] Group Members Present Findings

Tasks:
* [ ] Further Dataset Analysis

**Week 5**
* [ ] Group Members Present Findings

Tasks:
* [ ] Discuss Future steps
